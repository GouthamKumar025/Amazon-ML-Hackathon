<h1>Product Dimension Prediction</h1>
<h2>Problem statement of Amazon Machine Learning Hackathon - 2023</h2>

Predicting product dimensions using machine learning typically involves creating a regression model. Regression models are used when the output variable is a continuous value, which is the case with product dimensions. Here's a general guide on how you can approach predicting product dimensions using machine learning:

<h2>1. Data Collection:</h2>
Collect a dataset that includes features (input variables) and the corresponding product dimensions (output variable). The features could include various attributes of the product, such as weight, material, shape, and any other relevant characteristics.

<h2>2. Data Preprocessing:</h2>
Clean and preprocess the data. This involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features if necessary. Ensure that the dataset is ready for training.

<h2>3. Feature Selection:</h2>
Select the most relevant features for predicting product dimensions. You can use techniques like feature importance analysis, correlation analysis, or domain knowledge to guide your feature selection process.

<h2>4. Model Selection:</h2>
Choose a regression algorithm suitable for your dataset. Common regression algorithms include:
<ul>
  <li>Linear Regression</li>
  <li>Decision Trees</li>
  <li>Random Forest</li>
  <li>Support Vector Regression</li>
  <li>Neural Networks (Deep Learning)</li>
</ul>
The choice of the algorithm depends on the complexity of the problem and the nature of your dataset.

<h2>5. Model Training:</h2>
Split your dataset into training and testing sets. Train your chosen model on the training set. Adjust hyperparameters as needed to improve model performance.

<h2>6. Model Evaluation:</h2>
Evaluate your model's performance on the testing set using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), or R-squared. This step helps you understand how well your model generalizes to new, unseen data.

<h2>7. Model Fine-Tuning:</h2>
Based on the evaluation results, fine-tune your model. This may involve adjusting hyperparameters, trying different algorithms, or adding/removing features.

<h2>8. Deployment:</h2>
Once satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it to predict product dimensions for new data. Make sure to monitor the model's performance over time and update it as needed.
